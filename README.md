# Seeking Maintainers

Maintaining a project that is used by hundreds, thousands or even millions of
people can be stressful. Replying to issues, merging pull requests and answering
questions in forums is a vital part of every open source project, but it takes a
lot of time and energy, especially if you also work full-time in your day job.

This list is an index of open source projects seeking new maintainers. If you
find a project that sounds interesting and you're looking for a way to help out,
feel free to take a look at their posting and apply as a maintainer. If you
maintain a project yourself and feel stressed out, you're more than welcome to
add it to this list.

## How to add your project to this list

If you're interested in getting your site added to the Seeking Maintainers
index, all you need to do is to [file an
issue](https://github.com/garritfra/seeking-maintainers/issues) in this
repository using the "Add a new project" template and follow the instructions.

Please bear with us while a moderator reviews your submission. After your
submission is approved, the "seeking-maintainer" label is assigned to the issue,
which causes the project to show on the index.
